## Description
My motivation behind this project was to build a simple scheduling application so that 
I can visually see what tasks I have to do that day and when I have to do them. The way
the page dynamically updates with the time of day to highlight the current hour block
helps to differentiate what tasks have already passed, what task we should currently be
working on, and what tasks still lay ahead. I used the local storage API to store the 
information typed in each time block so that the informtation persists even if the page
is reloaded. Through the course of this project, I was able to gain a better understanding
of how local storage works and how to store and retrieve information. I was also able to 
practice using jQuery methods to make my code neater and more succinct.

## Attribution
I worked with a tutor to fix a bug where the classes that supply the background color
for each time block were not persisting past 5pm - the time where the time blocks on
the scheduling app end. She helped me rework the function on lines 8 - 25 of my JS file.
